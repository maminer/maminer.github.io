My research focuses on the interplay of inequality and institutions. As primarily a quantitative sociologist, I conduct research on school segregation, racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequality, educational policy, public trust/confidence in institutions and other issues related to science, knowledge and technology. My most recent work examines how school accountability ratings are associated with school segregation, how they shape public perceptions and how they influence parentsâ€™ enrollment decisions.
