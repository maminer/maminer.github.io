I am a Social Scientist and Research Methodologist focused on the interplay of inequality and institutions.

I received my Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee where I studied school segregation, public perceptions and research methodology.
I am currently <b>off<b> the market. I specialize in quantitative methods, education, social media and technology.

My publications and professional experience can be found on my <a href="/ma_miner.cv.pdf">CV</a>.
