I am a Research Scientist focused on the interplay of inequality and institutions. As a quantitative sociologist, I research inequality in education. I use large-scale secondary datasets and survey experiments to examine the mechanisms behind inequalities in schools, districts and metropolitan areas. My most recent work examines how school accountability ratings are associated with school segregation, how they shape public perceptions and how they influence parentsâ€™ enrollment decisions.
